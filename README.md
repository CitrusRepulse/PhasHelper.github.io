This code is free use. Make a website of your own with more style or with more features! But don't be a weirdo trying to sell my code to others it is free to use for a reason...

If you want you can credit me but it is nothing forced and I will not be a crybaby if you want to use my code without giving credit.
Don't try to report bugs to me this kind of a template and I will maybe make a few updates in the future.

This is made to help newer players learn how ghost act in different ways. What evidence you should be looking for, which sanity level ghosts hunt at and some more.

Possible future features:
